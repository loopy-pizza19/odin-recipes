    <h2>Woah, that looks good! Here's how to make it:</h2>
    <h3> -- Ingredients -- </h3>
    <p>Make sure <strong>not</strong> to go shopping for these items while you're hungry. Trust me, you end up with a whole 'nother grocery cart of stuff you dont need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices whole grain bread</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
        <li>2 slices Swiss cheese - (although I usually go for cheddar, but whatever grills your sandwich)</li>
        <li>2 thin slices deli ham </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon whole grain mustard</li>
        <li>1 cherry on top - (not really, that would be kind of gross)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> -- Directions -- </h3>
    <p>Now that we've got all of the ingredients, let's make this sandwich happen!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Spread one side of each slice of bread with 1 teaspoon butter</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place once slice butter-side down in the hot skillet. Top with Swiss cheese and ham. Spread the unbuttered side of second slice of bread with mayonnaise and mustard; place it butter-side up on sandwich</li>
            <p>  -- (Personally, I would add mayo to the other side too, but your sandwich, your life) -- </p>
            <li>Cook in the hot skillet until golden brown and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side. Try not to scroll on insta too much or it'll go from golden brown to outer-space black.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Plop it on a plate, wait a little bit, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>

    <h2>YOWZA!! Oh wait, they aren't real mummies. Phew!</h2>
    <h3> -- Ingredients -- </h3>
    <p>Make sure <strong>not</strong> to go shopping for these items while you're hungry. Trust me, you end up with a whole 'nother grocery cart of stuff you dont need</p>
    <ul>
        <li>8 hot dogs</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls -(Pillsbury is my go-to)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yellow mustard -(or more, whatever wraps your mummy)</li>
        
       
    </ul>
    <h3> -- Directions -- </h3>
    <p>Now that we've got all of the ingredients, let's bring these mummies to life!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place hot dogs in a saucepan and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until warmed through(about 5 minutes). Drain</li>
            <p> -- (Or you can keep the hot dog water if you want it for any other culinary endeavors) -- </p>
            <li>Roll crescent dough onto a work surface; tear into 8 pieces. Roll 1 piece dough around each hot dog, creating the look of the mummy. Place dots of mustard at the top for eyes(+ nose and mouth if feeling creative) Arrange hot dogs on a baking sheet</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Pop those bad-boys in the preheated oven until crescent dough is golden brown and flaky(about 10 minutes)</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Plop it on a plate, wait a little bit, and dig into those dogs!</li>
        </ol>
